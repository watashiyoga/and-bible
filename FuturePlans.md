Here are enhancements I hope to include in the upcoming releases.  Also see the [UserVoice page](https://andbible.uservoice.com) which influences the below list.

## Interlinear Greek/Hebrew ##
Multiple documents displayed vertically word-by-word matched on Strongs numbers.

## More Split Screen Functions ##
Remove the current split screen setting and add a sub-menu containing:
  * New split screen
  * Close split screen
  * Swap split screens OR ability to maximise lower screen
  * Link
  * Unlink
  * Open Strongs in lower window

## Standard Swipe ##
With positive feedback during swipe (ViewPager).

## SD Card selection ##
And Bible often uses the default internal SD card even though a larger external SD card is available.

## TSK View ##
The TSK shows a list of verses.  It is tedious to click, back, click, back, etc.  It would be nice to show all the verse automatically a bit like the Bookmarks or Compare translations views.

## Reorganise and simplify the Menus ##
I am struggling to come up with a great idea that does not involve more clicks, but see the wiki page on this subject.

## Bookmark, My Note, Highlight, Label Integration ##
Some people have many bookmarks and would like improved label support for bookmarks and to be able to label My Notes.  Also there are many requests for highlighting.  I plan to integrate all the above and improve labels.

## Better Book Index Navigation ##
Large books like Josephus are very difficult to navigate in And Bible.

## Touch to Select Verse ##
Allow multi-verse selection via touch.

## More Puritan Books ##
I enjoy listening to these so I intend to keep adding them.  I added 'Communion with God' by John Owen recently.

## Lookup Word in Dictionary ##
If page is not auto-scrolling a single touch on  a word will invoke a lookup on all installed dictionaries with a pop-up box to show results.  E.g. touch Gilgal would show an occurrence in ISBE, possibly elsewhere too.

## Personal Note ##
I work on And Bible in my spare time so please be aware all this will happen slowly and some trickier changes may be shelved for a while.  If you would like to contribute then the source is on github.
