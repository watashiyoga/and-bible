# Introduction #

I am an evangelical bible believing Christian living in North London.  Also, I have been a Java developer for about 15 years.

# And Bible #

With the demise of my favourite bible software, and it's O.S. Windows Mobile I decided to create a bible software package that I would be able to modify and maintain myself.  I discovered the great Java combination of JSword and Android and made these 2 technologies the base for And Bible.  The Crosswire Sword project provides an excellent array of biblical modules in many languages.

I hope you enjoy using And Bible.
