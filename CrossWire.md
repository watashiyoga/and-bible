# The CrossWire Bible Society #

# Introduction #

The CrossWire Bible Society is an organization with the purpose to sponsor and provide a place for engineers and others to come and collaborate on free, open-source projects aimed at furthering the Kingdom of our God. We are also a resource pool to other Bible societies and Christian organizations that can't afford-- or don't feel it's their place-- to maintain a quality programming staff in house. We provide them with a number of tools that assist them with reaching their domain with Christ.
