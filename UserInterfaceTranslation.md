# User Interface Translation #

If you would like to volunteer to translate the And Bible user interface into another language or to update an existing translation then either e-mail [And Bible Support](mailto:help.andbible@gmail.com) or volunteer via the And Bible discussion group.

We use a web based tool named [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to manage and simplify user interface translation.  Both text from And Bible and JSword can be translated via Transifex.

You can view the status of current translations [here](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/andbible/).
